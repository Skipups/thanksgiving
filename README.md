## Assignment

## To install

Run `npm install`
Make a database called `tgives`

#### Models Directions

You need to make 2 models: person and dish.

A person has name and an attending status.

A dish has name and description.

Each person is responsible for a dish.

~Be sure to create a seed file as the tests will wipe the database everytime you run them.

To run tests use `npm test`.

To run tests in watch mode use `npm test:watch`.
