# Assignment

## To install

Run `npm install`  
Make a database called `tgives`

#### Models Directions

You need to make 2 models: Person and Dish.

A person has name and an attending status.

A dish has name and description.

A person may be responsible for a dish.

~Be sure to create a seed file as the tests will wipe the database everytime you run them.

#### Routes directions

Follow tests to fillout appropriate routes for `api/people` and `api/dishes`.

To run tests use `npm test`.

To run tests in watch mode use `npm test:watch`.
